## 1. Introduction
The programming assignment requires implementing a technology mapping for FPGA, aiming to minimize the number of lookup tables (LUTs) used, which is an NP-hard problem. 


---

## 2. Approach and Complexity

#### 2.1 Approach v1.0
I use a cut-enumeration framework, which generates every feasible cut for each gate in the circuit, then applies a scoring function to determine which cut is better. 

$$
f(K, v) = \otimes^{K}_{u \in input(v)}[u + f(K, u)]
$$

The above equation from [2] gives the way to recusively calculate all the K feasible cut set of a gate v.

After obtaining the feasible cut set for a gate $v$, I use the formula below to calculate the cost($A_C$) of a cut $C$, which attempts to estimate the number of LUTs required if this cut is used [1, 2, 3, 4]. Then, I choose the cut with the minimal cost for $v$, which represents the LUT rooted at $v$.

$$
A_C = \sum_{i \in input(C)}[A_i/ref(i)] + 1
$$, where $ref(i)$ is the number of outgoing edge of gate $i$.

After the LUT for each gate is chosen based on the above approach, I start mapping the circuit into LUTs, beginning with the primary output gates. In the meantime, update $ref(i)$ to actual outgoing edge in mapping.

To summarize, my approach consists three steps:

1. generate all feasible cut for all gates.
2. Label each gate with an LUT which has minimun cost.
3. Map the circuit using the chosen LUTs and update $ref()$. 
    (then go back to step 2)

The number of iterations for steps 2 and 3 is set to a constant. 

#### 2.2 Time complexity of Approach v1.0

Let \(N\) denote the number of gates in the circuit, \(MC\) the maximum number of cuts among all gate, and \(K\) the number of inputs for the LUT used in mapping. Assume that every gate in the circuit is 2-bounded.

The time complexity of steps 1, 2, and 3 is \(O(N \cdot MC^2 \cdot K)\), \(O(N \cdot MC \cdot K)\), and \(O(N \cdot K)\), respectively.

It is clear that step 1 is the dominant step, as it involves a component that raises \(MC\) to the power of 2, which is problematic since \(MC\) is \(O(N^K)\).

#### 2.3 Approach v2.0
The execution time for Approach v1.0 on the spla circuit (which contains 7,454 gates) under $K=8$ was approximately 12 minutes. This aligns with the high complexity discussed in Section 2.2. However, this execution time exceeds the assignment requirement of 10 minutes, indicating that Approach v1.0 may not be suitable for this particular constraint.

To address the time complexity issue, I applied cut pruning [2]. In simple terms, this technique limits the number of cuts retained for each gate to a constant, denoted as $‚à£C‚à£$. If the number of cuts exceeds $|C|$, the cut with the larger cost is discarded. This approach helps in reducing the overall computational complexity and brings the execution time closer to the assignment requirements.

To summerize, approch v2.0 revises step 1 of v1.0:

1. generate **at most |C|** feasible cut for all gates.
The other steps remain unchanged.

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the performance of the cut-pruning version is very close to that of the original version. Due to the significantly reduced time complexity, the algorithm can run more iterations of steps 2 and 3, which I set to 10. As a result, the overall performance of approach v2.0 is slightly better than v1.0.

#### 2.4 Time complexity of Approach v2.0
The time complexity of step 1 becomes  \(O(N \cdot |C|^2 \cdot max(K, \log_{2}{(|C|^2)}))\), where $|C|$ is set to be 80 when $N <= 25000$, and $80 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{25000}{N}}$ when $N > 25000$ to meet the time constraint. Hope my estimation is not wrong ü´£. The \(\log\) term is due to sorting the cuts by cost. For step 2 and 3, time complexity remain the same.

## 4. Conclusion
In this assignment, I implemented a heuristic algorithm aimed at minimizing the number of LUTs used in mapping. Since depth is not considered, the concept of this algorithm is straightforward: enumerate the feasible cuts and select the one with the minimal area. Accurate area estimation is crucial‚Äîthe closer the estimated area is to the actual mapping result, the fewer LUTs will be used. After cut-pruning, performance is very close to the version that enumerates all cuts (at worst, only 2% less efficient) but with a significant speedup (approximately 16 times faster in the SPLA circuit with $K=8$). Lastly, due to reduced computation time, the algorithm can perform more iterations within the time constraint, making the cut-pruning version superior to the full enumeration version.
